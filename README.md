# Phenomics-flexFitR

[![Launch Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AparicioJohan/Phenomics-flexFitR/main?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository contains all materials for the `{flexFitR}`  module of the course Applied Phenomics: From Data Acquisition to Decision-Making in Breeding, held from August 5th to 7th.

In this module, we focus on modeling plant growth and phenotypic traits using nonlinear regression methods implemented in the `{flexFitR}`  R package. You'll learn how to fit, compare, and interpret nonlinear models for high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) data, particularly in the context of plant breeding.
